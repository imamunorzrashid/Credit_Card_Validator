# Credit_Card_Validator

The project "Credit Card Validator using Luhn Algorithm" is an object-oriented C++ program that offers a quick and effective way to validate credit card numbers. Based on a credit card number's structure and digits, the computer uses the Luhn Algorithm, a popular checksum technique, to assess its validity.

The Luhn Algorithm is a checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, including credit card numbers. It's a straightforward and effective technique for detecting errors in the credit card number, but it doesn't verify whether the card is active or if the transaction can be processed successfully.
